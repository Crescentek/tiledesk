## Generate self signed TLS certificates
For this article, letâ€™s generate a self-signed certificate with openssl. For production use, you should request a trusted, signed certificate through a provider or your own certificate authority (CA). In the next step, you generate a Kubernetes Secret using the TLS certificate and private key generated by OpenSSL.


The following example generates a 2048-bit RSA X509 certificate valid for 365 days named *tiledesk-ingress-tls.crt*. The private key file is named *tiledesk-ingress-tls.key*. A Kubernetes TLS secret requires *both* of these files.

This article works with the *console.tiledesk.local* subject common name and doesn't need to be changed. For production use, specify your own organizational values for the -subj parameter:

```console
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -out tiledesk-ingress-tls.crt \
    -keyout tiledesk-ingress-tls.key \
    -subj "/CN=console.tiledesk.local/O=tiledesk-ingress-tls"
```

```console
kubectl create secret tls tiledesk-tls-secret --key tiledesk-ingress-tls.key --cert tiledesk-ingress-tls.crt
```

Please see [this example](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tls) for more information.

## Generate GKE Managed TLS certificates

Create a ManagedCertificate resource. This resource specifies the domains that the SSL certificate will be created for. Wildcard domains are not supported.

kubectl apply -f ./enterprise/certificate-tiledesk.yaml


View your ssl certificates with: 

gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates list --project tiledesk-kube2

or with:

kubectl describe managedcertificate certificate-tiledesk

or with:

kubectl get certificates


delete with:
gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete mcrt-761d3c43-595c-4084-8c3b-707ed7b22098 --project tiledesk-kube2
