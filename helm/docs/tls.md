## Generate self signed TLS certificates
For this article, letâ€™s generate a self-signed certificate with openssl. For production use, you should request a trusted, signed certificate through a provider or your own certificate authority (CA). In the next step, you generate a Kubernetes Secret using the TLS certificate and private key generated by OpenSSL.


The following example generates a 2048-bit RSA X509 certificate valid for 365 days named *tiledesk-ingress-tls.crt*. The private key file is named *tiledesk-ingress-tls.key*. A Kubernetes TLS secret requires *both* of these files.

This article works with the *console.tiledesk.local* subject common name and doesn't need to be changed. For production use, specify your own organizational values for the -subj parameter:

```console
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -out tiledesk-ingress-tls.crt \
    -keyout tiledesk-ingress-tls.key \
    -subj "/CN=console.tiledesk.local/O=tiledesk-ingress-tls"
```

After creating the certificate please upload it using the following command:


```console
kubectl create secret tls tiledesk-tls-secret --key tiledesk-ingress-tls.key --cert tiledesk-ingress-tls.crt
```

Please see [this example](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tls) for more information.

## Generate GKE Managed TLS certificates

Create a ManagedCertificate resource. This resource specifies the domains that the SSL certificate will be created for. Wildcard domains are not supported.

Create a file named certificate-tiledesk.yaml like below:

```
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
name: certificate-tiledesk
spec:
domains:
- api.tiledesk.com
```

Create a new certificate for each domains you need. After that run:

```console
kubectl apply -f certificate-tiledesk.yaml
```


View your ssl certificates with: 

```console
gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates list --project tiledesk-kube2
```

or with:

```console
kubectl describe managedcertificate certificate-tiledesk
```

or with:

```console
kubectl get certificates
```

# Delete an existing GKE certificate

If you want to delete an existing certificate please run the following command:

```console
gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete mcrt-761d3c43-595c-4084-8c3b-XYZZZZZ --project tiledesk-kube
```
